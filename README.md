# Feature List

1. It is game controlled by IR Remote which send signal to IR sensor.
2. It is a game played bitween 2 players. player 1 have first turn and player 2 have second turn.
3. It is played in 3x3 grid.
4. It uses green LEDs for player 2 and red LEDs for player 1.
5. The player who suceeds in placing three of thir marks vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row is a winner
6. It can be updated and we can add more featues to the game.

# Requirements and Materials
Dependencies:
1. Arduino.IDE - It can be download from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. IRremote.h Liberary - It can be download from [IRremote-3.0.1.zip](https://github.com/AvijotSinghSidhu/CS207-Project-/files/6314806/IRremote-3.0.1.zip)

Bill of Materials:
1. 1 x Arduino UNO
2. 1 x IR sensor
3. 1 x IR remote
4. 18 x Resistors(220 ohm)
5. 2 x Breadbord
6. 1 x Arduino to USB cable

# Building Instructions

# Usage
1. It can be used to play game when you want.
2. It can be used to learn code Arduino UNO and C++ .
3. It is a good time game as it is portable. 

# Planed Featuers
1. I want to add player vs computer feature to it.
2. I want to add computer vs computer feature to it. 
3. I want to reduse number of pin it use on arduino.
4. I want to add reset button to IR Remote.
5. I want to add Colour slecting feature.
6. I improve its physical design.

# Bug List
1. Some times IR sensor ditects 0 even if button is not pressed on Remote

# Credits
1. I have taken help form this YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2HC3bdFoPw to set up IR sensor
2. I have taken help from this website https://www.instructables.com/Intelligent-Arduino-Tic-Tac-Toe-Noughts-and-Crosse/ with my code. But it is completely different think.


# Thanks
1. I would like to thank my class Instructor Trevor Tomesh 
2. I would like to thank my Lab Instructors Alex Clark and Levi Brown
